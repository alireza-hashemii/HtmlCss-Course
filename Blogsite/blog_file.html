            <p>The conflict has its The Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political conflict in the Levant. Beginning in the mid-20th century, it is one of the world's longest-continuing conflicts.[17] Key areas of the conflict include the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the status of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, borders, security and water rights,[18] as well as Palestinian freedom of movement[19] and the Palestinian right of return.

                The conflict has its origins in the arrival of Jewish immigrants and settlers to Palestine in the late 19th and 20th centuries and the advent of the Zionist movement.[20] The local Arab population opposed Zionism, primarily out of fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.[20] The Zionist movement garnered the support of an imperial power in the 1917 Balfour Declaration issued by Britain, which promised to support the creation of a "Jewish homeland in Palestine". Following World War I, Mandatory Palestine was established, and tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between Jews and Arabs.[21][22] In 1936, an Arab revolt erupted demanding independence, which the British suppressed.[23]
                
                The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine triggered the 1948 Palestine war, which saw the expulsion and flight of most Palestinian Arabs, the establishment of Israel on most of the Mandate's territory, and the control of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank by Egypt and Jordan, origins in the arrival of Jewish immigrants and settlers to <br> Palestine in the late 19th and 20th centuries and the advent of the Zionist movement.
